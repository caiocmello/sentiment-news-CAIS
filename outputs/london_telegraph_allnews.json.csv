To complicate matters, the IOC receive £60 million a year from Dow, who have dismissed the protests against them.

1965	He writes: “I will cut fares by 7% this year and freeze them throughout 2013.”  Cutting travel costs is a real crowd pleaser in London, where many live more than an hour away from work.

1968	 Unemployment  London unemployment rate floated one to two per cent above the national average for more than a decade, and has echoed the nationwide rise since the financial crisis in 2008.

1969	 Boris Johnson promises in his manifesto to combat this by creating 200,000 jobs in London in the next four years, including 10,000 roles through the Olympic legacy and 14,000 in the Crossrail scheme.

1970	" Livingstone takes the alternative view that the London mayor's powers are insufficient to ""boost growth in London's economy"".  However, he claims that with his policies Londoners will have more money in their pocket and will be better equipped to survive the economic crisis."

1974	 Although this has provided relief for home-owners, who have seen their assets grow in value, first-time buyers are struggling to get onto the property ladder.	"[{""text"": ""first"", ""type"": ""ORDINAL"", ""start"": 94, ""end"": 99, ""cms"": null}]"	149
1975	 Deposit requirements have risen beyond the reach of many young workers.

"[{""text"": ""Livingstone"", ""type"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 74, ""end"": 85, ""cms"": null}]"	149

1977	 Similarly, Johnson pledges 55,000 new affordable homes by 2015 for low and middle income workers,  He adds: “I will boost the First-Steps programme of low-cost home ownership products as their circumstances change, and encouraging providers to develop products which let households convert rent into equity”.

1978	The relay ritual itself is a relatively recent Olympic confection, but the symbolism of its journey from the movement’s spiritual home to the London stadium is an attempt to tie the ancient Games to the modern.

2666	 While I am never one to shy away from being competitive, the encouragement of young people towards sport has to be done in the right way.	[]	71
2667	 Sport should not be portrayed to them just in terms of winners and losers.	[]	71

2713	After the games are over, the temporary seating structures that form the 'wings’ of the building will be removed and the walls of the core structure will be completed creating an enduring aquatics facility that many thousands are expected to benefit from in the future.  Balfour Beatty will continue to manage and operate the building, as well as the rest of the Park, helping to fulfil the potential of the Olympic legacy.  Using the same planning processes and assumptions we built innovative bridges that span the river that meanders around the park.

2715	 Of course once the events are over, visitors will continue to enjoy the wonderful parkland that has been created around the sports facilities but in much smaller numbers.

3117	 Hone said: “The four bidders have put some requirement on the LLDC as the landlord — seating, roof, hospitality – they change from bid to bid.”  Hone said if none of the current bidders were accepted, with a decision expected in the first half of next year, the promise to the International Association of Athletics Federations for covered seating during the hosting of the 2017 World Athletics Championships may have to be renegotiated.	"[{""text"": ""Hone"", ""type"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 1, ""end"": 5, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""four"", ""type"": ""CARDINAL"", ""start"": 17, ""end"": 21, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""LLDC"", ""type"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 63, ""end"": 67, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""Hone"", ""type"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 146, ""end"": 150, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""the first half of next year"", ""type"": ""DATE"", ""start"": 230, ""end"": 257, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""the International Association of Athletics Federations"", ""type"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 274, ""end"": 328, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""2017"", ""type"": ""DATE"", ""start"": 375, ""end"": 379, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""World Athletics Championships"", ""type"": ""EVENT"", ""start"": 380, ""end"": 409, ""cms"": null}]"	53
3118	 He said it was unlikely the corporation would pay for covered seating without the changes being required by a long-term tenant.	[]	53
3119	If no changes were required the stadium could be open to athletics in 2014, when the northern area of Olympic Park featuring the VeloPark cycling centre is expected to open to the public.

3120	 Hone explained that the modifications, if a long-term tenant was appointed, may be lengthy because of the need for detailed design, construction and reconfiguration and may push back occupancy of the stadium to August 2015 at the earliest, or even August 2016.	"[{""text"": ""Hone"", ""type"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 1, ""end"": 5, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""August 2015"", ""type"": ""DATE"", ""start"": 212, ""end"": 223, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""August 2016"", ""type"": ""DATE"", ""start"": 249, ""end"": 260, ""cms"": null}]"	53

3124	 Hone said it was a reasonable estimate to expect £1.1 billion from this housing development, but that the time frame, originally anticipated to be until 2030, may be fast-tracked because of strong demand for housing in the capital.

3263	 On Friday night, he said his comments were in response to a question from the audience and that he was not criticising other Olympic sports but merely pointing out the difference with athletics.  “I made the point, and perhaps it was an ill-chosen phrase, that one of the reasons we do well in certain sports is perhaps because we have the financial wherewithal to achieve a level that others can’t.  “There are some sports where certain well-applied financial modals can bring you a certain advantage.

3655	The policy, agreed following a fierce debate between education secretary Michael Gove and health minister Jeremy Hunt mediated by Prime Minister David Cameron and his legacy adviser Lord Coe, will commit around £100 million a year to school sport, with the focus on primary schools.

3657	 The departments of health, education and culture are all expected to commit funding, with ministers keen to ensure the annual commitment exceeds £100 million to make sure the commitment is taken seriously.

3658	 Under the new policy schools will source specialist coaching provision from sports clubs and governing bodies, with the Football Association and the Premier League, the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Rugby Football Union and the Lawn Tennis Association all committed to supporting the scheme.	"[{""text"": ""the Football Association"", ""type"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 117, ""end"": 141, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""the Premier League"", ""type"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 146, ""end"": 164, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""the England and Wales Cricket Board"", ""type"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 166, ""end"": 201, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""the Rugby Football Union"", ""type"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 203, ""end"": 227, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""the Lawn Tennis Association"", ""type"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 232, ""end"": 259, ""cms"": null}]"	90
3659	 It is hoped their involvement will allow schools to be more flexible, though critics fear that the policy does not address the fundamental problem of the lack of specialist PE training provided to teachers.	[]	90
3660	 In a compromise intended to appease Gove’s commitment to decentralising education, the funding will be ring-fenced but will be paid direct to schools, and decisions on how lessons are provided will be made at a local level.	"[{""text"": ""Gove"", ""type"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 37, ""end"": 41, ""cms"": null}]"	90

3662	 Ministers have long conceded privately that the lack of a coherent school sport policy has been a glaring hole in its 2012 legacy planning and undermined the Olympic pledge to “inspire a generation”.

3663	 One of the Government’s first acts after the 2010 election was to cut £162 million-a-year of ring-fenced funding for school sport, an ideological decision driven by Gove’s conviction that individual heads should have the power to spend budgets as they pleased rather than follow central diktat.

3665	 The changes, less than two years before the London Olympics, were a huge own-goal and a backlash led by Olympians prompted a partial about-turn, and the reduced funding provided runs out at the end of the current academic year.

3666	 While funding for elite athletes and grassroots sports was agreed last year, provision for the most crucial area of all has been held up by Gove’s reluctance to change course.

3667	 Given the central role schools play in inspiring an interest in sport, as well as instilling a commitment to exercise, the lack of progress represents a damning omission.	[]	90
3668	 Negotiations have been glacial, with Gove and Hunt fundamentally disagreeing over the way forward.	"[{""text"": ""Gove"", ""type"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 38, ""end"": 42, ""cms"": null}, {""text"": ""Hunt"", ""type"": ""PERSON"", ""start"": 47, ""end"": 51, ""cms"": null}]"	90

3670	 That runs counter to the entire direction of Gove’s reforms, and the pair reached an impasse that meant an announcement was pushed back from a planned launch date last December.

3673	As a Tory peer and former MP the London 2012 chairman is sympathetic with the reform agenda, but as an Olympian whose passion was sparked by teachers in a Sheffield state school in the 1960s, he is just as convinced of the importance of proper sport provision to the education of the nation’s children.

3674	 The agreed compromise is expected to mean schools receive guaranteed funding but commission services themselves locally while Ofsted, which recently published a damning assessment of state school sport, will provide quality control.	"[{""text"": ""Ofsted"", ""type"": ""ORG"", ""start"": 127, ""end"": 133, ""cms"": null}]"	90
3675	 The focus on primary schools is an attempt to redress the fact that most teachers receive only cursory training in PE, as well as to try and capture the imagination of children at their most receptive.	[]	90
3676	 The involvement of governing bodies is consistent with the government’s attempts to spread responsibility for sports provision away from the state.	[]	90
3677	Grassroots funding to governing bodies for example is conditional on them working with their clubs to increase participation.	[]	90
3678	 The FA and Premier League believe their clubs can offer a service to schools, with community coaches ready to work within the curriculum or after school and at weekends depending on a school's requirements.
