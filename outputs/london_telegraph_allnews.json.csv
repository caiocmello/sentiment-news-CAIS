2959	 The organisation decided to spend Â£250,000 of its proceeds on a scheme to improve school rugby and described to MSPs the disturbing results of tests conducted on S1 and S2 pupils.  Using an American system called Functional Movement Screening, they were asked to perform seven basic movements required for them to lead a healthy lifestyle, including a deep squat or a push-up.  âDuring our pilot projects we found that pupilsâ fitness levels and physical competencies were so poor coming into secondary school, that we had to set our targets at a realistic level,â the submission to Holyroodâs health and sport committee states.

3263	 On Friday night, he said his comments were in response to a question from the audience and that he was not criticising other Olympic sports but merely pointing out the difference with athletics.  âI made the point, and perhaps it was an ill-chosen phrase, that one of the reasons we do well in certain sports is perhaps because we have the financial wherewithal to achieve a level that others canât.  âThere are some sports where certain well-applied financial modals can bring you a certain advantage.

3312	 Jennie Price, the chief executive of Sport England, said: âDuring the spring and early summer before the Games started, when there was a lot of pretty disgusting weather, some of the pitch sports and other sports had a lot of things cancelled.  âThis included cycling, whose figures went down, but they got a real boost in the three months around the Games.

3315	Last year, the Government was forced to abandon the previous Labour governmentâs Olympic legacy target of an extra one million people playing sport three times a week, though the latest figures suggest that retreat might have been overstated.

3319	 Price said that, while there was no doubt that London 2012 had created a grassroots âbounceâ, Sport England had been working closely with the governing bodies since 2009 to increase participation levels, with funding levels being set accordingly.

3677	Grassroots funding to governing bodies for example is conditional on them working with their clubs to increase participation.	[]	90
