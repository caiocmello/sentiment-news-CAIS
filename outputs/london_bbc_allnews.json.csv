1142	The removal of travellers from the Olympic site means the first legacy was a loss of homes  We should be cautiously optimistic about London 2012's housing legacy.

1162	Development of the Isle of Dogs in the 1980s proved out of the reach of many local people  On the Isle of Dogs as in Stratford, policy makers were keen to rebalance the tenure mix through an increase in owner-occupation.  Housing waiting lists grew and for those residents able to buy, to do so often meant leaving the area as prices became increasingly unaffordable.  Many of these developments offered discounted housing to buy for local residents but for most this was simply not affordable.  Policy makers will be keen to distance themselves from the social polarisation on the Isle of Dogs, but there are parallels that will need to be addressed if Stratford's residents and more generally people on low incomes are to benefit from regeneration.

1971	 Withholding money from sports governing bodies unless they deliver on targets for getting young people to particpate in those sports will also help concentrate minds.	[]	259

Simon Morton, UK Sport's director of major events and international relations, said ""several British cities"" could bid for the Commonwealth Games in the 2020s.

Morton said that as a result, the European Championships was the largest swimming event that the aquatics centre could bid for.

More than 70,000 cyclists of all ages and abilities are expected to take part in four separate Ride London events on 3-4 August.  The highlight will be a 100 mile (160km) race from London to Surrey.  The event has been called a key strand of the post-2012 Olympic and Paralympic legacy and is expected to be the largest mass participation cycling festival ever held in the UK.  Starting in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, the route will pass many of London's iconic landmarks, before heading through Richmond Park and out into the Surrey Hills.  The ride will also include a steep climb up Box Hill and Leith Hill before returning to finish at The Mall in central London.  Mr Johnson said: ""Following the superhuman efforts of our Team GB cyclists last year, thousands of cycling enthusiasts, both experienced and amateur, riding a fantastic route through the streets of our fine city is surely a fitting legacy.""  'Piece of cake'  Speaking at a press conference, he said he would be taking part.
