2333	 Enjoyment is not a word much used in a sport in which training and races typically leave the athletes breathless with agony.	[]	78
2334	And for Britain’s 70-year-old coach Jürgen Grobler, who can now lay claim to more Olympic gold medals than several island nations, this will be further vindication of the infamous hell-camps he puts his athletes through (Gregory has acknowledged that vomiting is now just part of his day job).  The German allowed himself a smile as his athletes met him on the pontoon, but he wasn’t ready to indulge in any history talk.
